            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              I am an undergraduate student at Princeton University within the Class of 2026, pursuing a degree in Computer Science with an intended minor in Statistics & Machine Learning. Currently, I am involved on campus within several organizations such as  AI@Princeton, Data Science Club, National Society of Black Engineers, African Students Association, Tigers in Product, and the Office of Information Technology. Outside of school, I have experience within software engineering, artificial intelligence research, product management, and venture capital. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">
             Borne out of a passion for problem solving, innovation within computer science has become my main area of intellectual curiosity. As one who always struggled to solve a rubix cube, I was fascinated when I learned how to use deep learning to teach a computer to solve a rubix cube during a summer internship at the Artificial Intelligence Institute within the University of South Carolina. Specifically, our team implemented a Deep Reinforcement Learning model (Planning Domain Definition Language). Afterwards, we applied Planning Domain Definition Language to assist in maximizing the probability of goal achievement, optimizing probability to 99% of all test configurations, finding a shortest path to the goal state 60.3% of the time and generalizing the model to other combinatorial puzzles. Furthermore, I was able to apply artificial intelligence algorithms to detect tumor cells in single-cell DNA sequencing data at the National Institutes of Health during a summer internship.  For more details, please refer to my <a href="file/portfoliores.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>. What made these experiences particularly enriching for me was that it gave me a first glance at how powerful engineering can be as a tool for solving everyday problems. Engineering was no longer an abstract process that resulted in results only relevant to me in the context of my lab at school, but one that could help people across the world. These experiences bred my passion for computer science and guide me towards my future endeavors, where I aspire to utilize applications of computer science to assist in efforts to solve everyday problems in society.
